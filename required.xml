Ingredients (5)

    1 pound fresh, sashimi-quality fish, such as yellowfin tuna or salmon
    2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
    4 teaspoons shiro dashi or regular Japanese soy sauce
    2 teaspoons white sesame seeds
    1/2 teaspoon thinly sliced chives

Summary

Chef Wayne Nish celebrates high-quality, fresh fish with this sashimi preparation.

What to buy: Sashimi is all about the fish; with so few ingredients it’s imperative to buy the best you can find. We made this with yellowfin tuna, though it would be equally good with salmon or hamachi. Buy your fish from a reputable source, and let your fishmonger know that you will be serving it raw so he or she gives you a top-quality piece.

Regular soy sauce is fermented from 80 percent soybeans and 20 percent wheat. White soy sauce, or shiro-shoyu, is made from the opposite: 80 percent wheat and 20 percent soybeans. Then niboshi (tiny dried sardines), kombu (dried giant seaweed), and dried shiitake mushrooms are added to produce a more flavorful brew called shiro dashi, which can be found in Japanese and Asian markets or online. If shiro dashi is not readily available, just use a regular high-quality Japanese soy sauce.

Game plan: To maintain the quality of the fish, serve it on chilled plates and keep the sashimi in the refrigerator until you are ready to slice it.

Instructions

    1Remove fish from the refrigerator and, using a sharp knife with a thin blade, slice very thinly. Divide slices of fish evenly among 8 plates.
    2Drizzle each serving with about 1/4 teaspoon olive oil and 1/2 teaspoon soy sauce, adding more as desired. Sprinkle sesame seeds and chives over fish and serve immediately.

Beverage pairing: Tozai Junmai Living Jewel Sake, Japan. Of course it’s natural to think of sake when eating sashimi. But sake does indeed have an ethereal delicateness that perfectly embellishes the creamy texture and pillowy softness of good fish.

    Heat a large stock pot over medium-high heat. Crumble the ground chuck and sausage into the hot pan, and cook until evenly browned. Drain off excess grease.
    Pour in the chili beans, spicy chili beans, diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Add the onion, celery, green and red bell peppers, chile peppers, bacon bits, bouillon, and beer. Season with chili powder, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, oregano, cumin, hot pepper sauce, basil, salt, pepper, cayenne, paprika, and sugar. Stir to blend, then cover and simmer over low heat for at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
    After 2 hours, taste, and adjust salt, pepper, and chili powder if necessary. The longer the chili simmers, the better it will taste. Remove from heat and serve, or refrigerate, and serve the next day.
    To serve, ladle into bowls, and top with corn chips and shredded Cheddar cheese.
